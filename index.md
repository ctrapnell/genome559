## Course description
Rudiments of statistical and computational genomics. Emphasis on basic probability and statistics, introduction to computer programming and relevant web databases. This course is intended to introduce students with non-computer science backgrounds to the major concepts of programming and statistics.

## Instructional staff
* [William Stafford Noble](http://noble.gs.washington.edu/~noble)
* [Cole Trapnell](http://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/)
* Teaching assistant: [Jonathan Packer](http://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/team/jonathan-packer/)

## Meeting times and locations
### Classes: 

Tuesday and Thursday, 10:30 - 11:50 am, [Foege Building S040](http://www.washington.edu/home/maps/southcentral.html?gnom).

### Office hours: 
* Mondays, 4-5pm in [Foege Building S110](http://www.washington.edu/home/maps/southcentral.html?gnom)
* Fridays, 2-3p in Foege in the area where Vista Cafe used to be (back of the 1st floor)

## Prerequisites
Substantial background in molecular and cellular biology, genetics, biochemistry, or related disciplines.

## Course materials
Readings for the Python parts of the class will be assigned from the free online textbook Think Python. A listing of additional reference material can be found here.

## Course requirements
* The course involves hands-on programming during class time, so students should bring a laptop to class.
* All problem sets are due by the start of class on the date listed.
* Late homework will be accepted, but penalized. Specifically, each assignment is worth 100 points, from which 10 points will be deducted for each day (or fraction thereof) that you turn it in late. The maximum deduction for being late is 60 points (even if you are more than 6 days late).
* You are welcome to talk to classmates about principles for solving problems, but please do not solve specific problems together. In many ways, the problem solving is where you will learn the most for this class, especially the programming.

## Examinations

There will be an in-class final exam on the last day of class.

## Course grade
Grades will come 80% from problem sets and 20% from one final exam. There will be no mid-term exam.
